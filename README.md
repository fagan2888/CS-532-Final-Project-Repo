# CS 532 Final Project Code Repository
By [Rebekah Dix](https://github.com/rebekahanne) and [Joseph Fry](https://github.com/JosephPatrickFry).

1. [Click here to download the whole repository](http://github.com/rebekahanne/CS-532-Final-Project-Repository/archive/master.zip)
2. Open the .zip file just downloaded.
3. Open the Matlab files as instructed in the tutorial. 

## IMPORTANT
Do not change the file structure of the un-zipped folder. You can either set your Matlab filepath to this folder (called CS-532-Final-Project-Repo-master when un-zipped) or move this folder to your current path. Inside the folder are two folders with helper functions and data. Do not move these folders or the files within them. These will automatically be called when needed from the main Matlab scripts.
